# Clinical Management System

## Description:
  - The biggest problem facing health care centres remains today. Technical problems. There is a rare health care centre that works with a modern and organised technical system that helps it organise the schedule, payment methods, save patient data, and communicate. So we were keen to find a solution to this problem, Through a Desktop  application that contains a page for the patient that enables him to record his data, book an appointment to visit the doctor, describe the pain, and view the doctor's data, a page for the nurse that enables her to confirm the patient's reservation and conduct medical tests, and another for the doctor that enables him to view the patient's data, write his prescription, and print.

## Features:
- A page for the patient that enables him to record his data, book an appointment to visit the doctor.
- The patient can describe the pain, and view the doctor's profile.
- A page for the nurse that enables her to confirm the patient's reservation and conduct medical tests.
- A page for the doctor that enables him to view the patient's data, write his prescription, and print.
